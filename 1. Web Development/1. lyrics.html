    [Verse 1]
    I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me when we're alone
    You can hold my hand if no one's home
    Do you like it when I'm away?
    If I went and hurt my body, baby, would you love me the same?
    I can feel all my bones coming back and I'm craving motion
    Mama never really learned how to live by herself
    It's a curse and it's growing
    You're a pond and I'm an ocean, oh
    All my emotions feel like explosions when you are around
    And I've found a way to kill the sound, oh

    [Chorus]
    Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
    I need you here to stay
    I broke all my bones that day I found you
    Crying at the lake
    Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
    Oh, and if I could take it all back
    I swear that I would pull you from the tide

    [Verse 2]
    Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
    I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)
    Listen close, it's a no
    The wind is a-pounding on my back
    And I've found hope in a heart attack
    Oh, at last, it is past
    Now I've got it, and you can't have it

    [Chorus]
    Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
    I need you here to stay
    I broke all my bones that day I found you
    Crying at the lake
    Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
    Oh, and if I could take it all back
    I swear that I would pull you from the tide

    [Bridge]
    Darling, when I'm fast asleep
    I've seen this person watching me
    Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"
    Oh-oh
    'Cause there is something and there is nothing
    There is nothing in-between
    And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer watching over me
    He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
    He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without aâ€”"

    [Chorus]
    Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
    I need you here to stay
    Broke all my bones that day I found you
    Crying at the lake
    Oh, was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
    Oh, and if I could take it all back
    I swear that I would pull you from the tide
